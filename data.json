It may seem rather daunting having to take all this new information on board, but by breaking down each of the different elements involved, you'll find that you can make sense of all these essential pieces of the puzzle.\n\n If you're thinking of building a website, then you'll almost certainly have come across the acronyms HTML and CSS. These two essential tools form some of the foundations of any webpage. However, although they're often used in conjunction with each other, they both serve very different purposes when it comes to web coding.The key differences lie in their implementation, ease of use, their various features, and how they are structured, but at the end of the day, both HTML and CSS are the keys to unlocking how the World Wide Web works.",

JavaScript is an interpreted language. Thus, it doesn't need to be compiled. JavaScript renders web pages in an interactive and dynamic fashion. This allowing the pages to react to events, exhibit special effects, accept variable text, validate data, create cookies, detect a user's browser, etc.\n\n HTML pages are fine for displaying static content, e.g. a simple image or text. However, most pages nowadays are rarely static. Many of today's pages have menus, forms, slideshows and even images that provide user interaction. Javascript is the language employed by web developers to provide such interaction. Since JavaScript works with HTML pages, a developer needs to know HTML to harness this scripting language's full potential. While there are other languages that can be used for scripting on the Web, in practice it is essentially all Javascript.",

There are many jobs available for a 'C' developer in the current market. \n'C' is a structured programming language in which program is divided into various modules. Each module can be written separately and together it forms a single 'C' program. This structure makes it easy for testing, maintaining and debugging processes.'C' contains 32 keywords, various data types and a set of powerful built-in functions that make programming very efficient. \n\nAnother feature of 'C' programming is that it can extend itself. A 'C' program contains various functions which are part of a library. We can add our features and functions to the library. We can access and use these functions anytime we want in our program. This feature makes it simple while working with complex programming. Various compilers are available in the market that can be used for executing programs written in this language. It is a highly portable language which means programs written in 'C' language can run on other machines. This feature is essential if we wish to use or execute the code on another computer.",

It's used for building interactive user interfaces and web applications quickly and efficiently with significantly less code than you would with vanilla JavaScript. In React, you develop your applications by creating reusable components that you can think of as independent Lego blocks.\n\n These components are individual pieces of a final interface, which, when assembled, form the application's entire user interface. React's primary role in an application is to handle the view layer of that application just like the V in a model-view-controller (MVC) pattern by providing the best and most efficient rendering execution. Rather than dealing with the whole user interface as a single unit, React.js encourages developers to separate these complex UIs into individual reusable components that form the building blocks of the whole UI. In doing so, the ReactJS framework combines the speed and efficiency of JavaScript with a more efficient method of manipulating the DOM to render web pages faster and create highly dynamic and responsive web applications.",
